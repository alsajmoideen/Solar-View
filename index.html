    <h2>About Solar System</h2>
    <p>
      The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit the star.
      The largest of such objects are the eight planets, in order from the Sun: four terrestrial planets named Mercury,
      Venus, Earth and Mars,
      two gas giants named Jupiter and Saturn, and two ice giants named Uranus and Neptune.
      The terrestrial planets have a definite surface and are mostly made of rock and metal. The gas giants are mostly
      made of hydrogen and helium, while the ice giants are mostly made of 'volatile' substances such as water,
      ammonia, and methane. In some texts, these terrestrial and giant planets are called the inner Solar System and
      outer Solar System planets respectively.
      The Solar System was formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar
      molecular cloud. Over time, the cloud formed the Sun and a protoplanetary disk that gradually coalesced to form
      planets and other objects.
      That is the reason why all eight planets have an orbit that lies near the same plane. In the present day, 99.86%
      of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and most of the remaining mass is contained in the planet Jupiter.
      Six planets, six largest possible dwarf planets and many other bodies have natural satellites or moons orbiting
      around them. All giant planets and a few smaller bodies are encircled by planetary rings, composed of ice, dust
      and sometimes moonlets.
